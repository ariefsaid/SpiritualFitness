# Clerk & Supabase Integration Implementation Plan

## 1. Dependencies Status
- ✅ Next.js with TypeScript (already set up)
- ✅ Clerk SDK (package.json shows it's installed)
- ⚠️ Need to install Supabase client:
  ```bash
  npm install @supabase/supabase-js
  ```

## 2. Key Files to Create/Update

### Authentication Layer
- Create: `app/lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client with Clerk token integration
- Update: `app/middleware.ts` - Configure Clerk middleware
- Create: `app/providers.tsx` - Add Clerk provider wrapper

### Base Configuration
- Environment variables already configured (✅)
- Middleware protection for authenticated routes
- Supabase-Clerk token forwarding setup

### Folder Structure (Current = Good)
```
app/
  lib/
    supabase.ts (new)
  middleware.ts (update)
  providers.tsx (new)
```

## 3. Implementation Steps

1. Initialize Supabase client with Clerk integration
2. Set up Clerk middleware for route protection
3. Add Clerk provider to wrap application
4. Configure Supabase RLS policies
5. Test authentication flow

## 4. Next Steps (Future Tickets)
- User profile syncing between Clerk and Supabase
- Enhanced RLS policies
- Storage bucket configuration
- Offline data sync strategy
