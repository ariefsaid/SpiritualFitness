i have no tables at all in this new project. what is the auth.users table? do I need to create one as well? what is the difference ? is it necessary?

The auth.users table is automatically created by Supabase when you enable authentication in your project. It is part of the Supabase Auth system and is used to store user accounts, including their email addresses, passwords (hashed), and other authentication-related information. You do not need to create this table manually; it is managed by Supabase.

Key Points about auth.users Table
Automatic Creation: The auth.users table is created automatically when you set up authentication in your Supabase project. You can view it in the Supabase dashboard under the "Table Editor" section, but it is located in the auth schema, not the public schema.

Purpose: This table is specifically designed to handle user authentication. It contains fields like:

id: A unique identifier for each user (UUID).
email: The user's email address.
hashed_password: The hashed version of the user's password.
created_at: Timestamp of when the user was created.
Other fields related to user authentication and management.
Difference Between auth.users and profiles Table
auth.users Table:

Managed by Supabase.
Contains authentication-related information.
Automatically created when you enable authentication.
profiles Table:

Typically created by you (the developer).
Stores additional user information that is not directly related to authentication (e.g., display name, avatar, bio).
Allows you to extend user data beyond what is provided by the auth.users table.
Is the profiles Table Necessary?
Not Mandatory: The profiles table is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended if you want to store additional user information. If your application requires user profiles with more details than what is provided by the auth.users table, you should create a profiles table.
Next Steps
Enable Authentication: If you haven't already, enable authentication in your Supabase project. This will create the auth.users table automatically.

Create the Profiles Table: If you need to store additional user information, create the profiles table as described in the previous response.

Implement Row Level Security: After creating the profiles table, enable Row Level Security (RLS) and define policies to control access to user profiles.
