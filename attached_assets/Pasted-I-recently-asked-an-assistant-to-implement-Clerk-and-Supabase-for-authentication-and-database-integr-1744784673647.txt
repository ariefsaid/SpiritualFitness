I recently asked an assistant to implement Clerk and Supabase for authentication and database integration, based on the prompt attached below. However, the app is currently not functioning or accessible.

All changes related to this implementation are captured between the following two Git ID:
• 28ebb69152d8531a1a27d04e500f3d260726cb56
• 54596de4507bb52baa65548ae615023ba2cdb523

Please do the following:

Tasks
1. Review the diff between the two gits to identify what was added or changed.
2. Compare the changes against the instructions in the attached implementation prompt (below) to ensure:
• Clerk is correctly integrated and configured
• Supabase is properly set up and used
• Environment variables are correctly accessed and not causing runtime failures
3. Diagnose the root cause of why the app is currently not accessible (e.g., build failure, routing error, Clerk misconfig, Supabase connection issue, etc.)
4. Suggest fixes or required corrections to restore app functionality.

<initial prompt> Please familiarize yourself with the existing codebase. We are integrating Supabase (for database and bucket storage) and Clerk (for user authentication) into this application.
<Ticket> ## Epic 1: Project Foundation & Authentication
Goal: Establish the core project structure for Faithful Steps using Next.js, set up the development environment, and implement secure user authentication using Clerk, enabling users to sign up, log in, and have their identity managed. Connect the frontend to the Supabase backend.

FS-2: Implement User Registration & Login UI with Clerk (Next.js)

Background: Create the basic UI components for user sign-up and sign-in using Next.js file-based routing. Integrate Clerk's Next.js components or use Clerk SDK hooks to build custom forms for handling registration and login using Clerk. Protect specific routes (community for now just to test functionality).
Acceptance Criteria:
A dedicated /sign-up route/page exists using Clerk's component.
A dedicated /sign-in route/page exists using Clerk's component.
Users can successfully register via the UI, handled by Clerk.
Users can successfully log in via the UI, handled by Clerk.
Appropriate loading states and error messages from Clerk are displayed to the user during auth processes.
Basic route protection using Clerk's Next.js helpers (e.g., withAuth) protects authenticated routes (e.g., a placeholder /community).
</Ticket>
Resources Provided:
I have provided the relevant quickstart documentations and chat transcript with assistants for clerk and supabase integrations, in the @/Reference/Clerk/ and @/Reference/Supabase/ respectively. I have also setup relevant API Keys for Clerk and Database in Replit Secrets, namely:
-NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
-CLERK_SECRET_KEY
-SUPABASE_URL
-SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
