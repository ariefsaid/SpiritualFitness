# Migration Plan: Express to Next.js

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step migration plan from the current Express/Vite/React architecture to a pure Next.js App Router architecture.

## Phase 1: API Migration (Completed)
- [x] Create Next.js API route handlers for quotes endpoints
- [x] Create Next.js API route handlers for achievements endpoints
- [x] Create Next.js API route handlers for community endpoints
- [x] Create Next.js API route handlers for prayer endpoints (skipped, will implement directly in Next.js)
- [x] Create Next.js API route handlers for fasting endpoints (skipped, will implement directly in Next.js)
- [x] Create Next.js API route handlers for Quran reading endpoints (skipped, will implement directly in Next.js)
- [x] Create Next.js API middleware for common functionality

## Phase 2: Data Layer Migration (Completed)
- [x] Move storage.ts from `/server` directory to `/app/lib/storage.ts`
- [x] Create a proper database connection layer in Next.js
- [x] Move schema.ts to `/app/lib/schema.ts`

- [ ] Validate offline functionality 
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Validate PWA installation and caching

## Phase 5: Cleanup & Optimization (In Progress)
- [x] Remove Express server code
- [x] Remove Vite configuration
- [x] Clean up deprecated dependencies
